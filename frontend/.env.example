# UFC Pokedex Frontend Environment Variables

# Backend API base URLs
# `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is used by client-side fetches.
# `NEXT_SSR_API_BASE_URL` is used by Next.js server-side rendering (SSR) and ISR routes.
# For local development, both should point to your FastAPI backend.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_SSR_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For Cloudflare Tunnel (when DNS propagates):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.ufc.wolfgangschoenberger.com
# See frontend/.env.tunnel for tunnel configuration

# Static assets base URL (optional)
# Used for serving images and other static files
# If not set, falls back to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
# Set this to bypass Next.js proxy for static assets (prevents circular proxy loops)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For production (if using CDN or separate asset server):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSETS_BASE_URL=https://assets.yourdomain.com

# Production Railway backend origin (used by Vercel SSR/ISR):
# NEXT_SSR_API_BASE_URL=https://fulfilling-nourishment-production.up.railway.app
