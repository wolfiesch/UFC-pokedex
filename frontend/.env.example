# UFC Pokedex Frontend Environment Variables

# Backend API base URL
# For local development, this should point to your FastAPI backend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Optional override for hosted deployments.  When unset, the frontend falls
# back to the production Railway instance defined in
# src/lib/deployment-config.ts.  Configure this if you fork the project and host
# your own backend under a different domain.
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_API_BASE_URL=https://fulfilling-nourishment-production.up.railway.app

# For Cloudflare Tunnel (when DNS propagates):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.ufc.wolfgangschoenberger.com
# See frontend/.env.tunnel for tunnel configuration

# Static assets base URL (optional)
# Used for serving images and other static files
# If not set, falls back to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
