# UFCStats Manual Exploration Notes

## Overview

These notes document the structure of the primary UFCStats resources required for the UFC Fighter Pokedex project. They cover the markup patterns, navigation flow, and data fields that will inform our scrapers and downstream models.

## Robots.txt & Politeness

- `https://www.ufcstats.com/robots.txt` allows crawling of the paths we require, including `/statistics/fighters`.
- No crawl-delay directive is provided; we will enforce 1–2s delays ourselves.
- Use a descriptive `User-Agent` (e.g. `UFC-Pokedex-Scraper/0.1 (+https://github.com/<org>/ufc-pokedex)`).

## Global Layout

- UFCStats serves static HTML generated by ASP.NET, no client-side rendering or XHR observed.
- Common layout elements:
  - Table-based listings (`<table class="b-statistics__table">`).
  - Data detail cards using `<section class="b-list__info-box">`.
  - Fighter URLs follow `http://ufcstats.com/fighter-details/<uuid>`.
  - Pagination uses query params `?page=all` or `?page=1`.

## Fighter List (`/statistics/fighters`)

- Table header row: `<th class="b-statistics__table-header">`.
- Table body rows: `<tr class="b-statistics__table-row">`.
- Useful selectors:
  - Name link: `tr.b-statistics__table-row td:nth-child(1) a`.
  - Nickname: `td:nth-child(1) span`.
  - Height: `td:nth-child(2) p`.
  - Weight: `td:nth-child(3) p`.
  - Reach: `td:nth-child(4) p`.
  - Stance: `td:nth-child(5) p`.
  - DOB: `td:nth-child(6) p`.
- Pagination controls located in `<a class="b-statistics__paginate-link">`. Value `next` indicates more pages; final page lacks the `next` link.

## Fighter Detail (`/fighter-details/<uuid>`)

- Hero section (`section.b-content__detail`) contains:
  - `span.b-content__title-highlight`: fighter name.
  - `span.b-content__Nickname`: nickname (optional).
  - `span.b-content__title-record`: overall record `W-L-D (NC)`.
- Bio info table (`ul.b-list__box-list` with `<li>` rows):
  - `Height`, `Weight`, `Reach`, `Leg Reach`, `Stance`, `DOB`.
- Stat boxes arranged in `<div class="b-list__info-box-left">` and `b-list__info-box-right`.
  - Each stat line uses `p.b-list__info-box-title` (label) + `p.b-list__info-box-left` / `right` (value).
- Fight history table:
  - `<table class="b-fight-details__table">`.
  - Each `<tr class="b-fight-details__table-row b-fight-details__table-row__hover">` entry contains:
    - Opponent link: `td:nth-child(2) a`.
    - Result: `td:nth-child(1)`.
    - Event: `td:nth-child(7) a`.
    - Method: `td:nth-child(8)`.
    - Round/Time: `td:nth-child(9)` / `td:nth-child(10)`.
    - Additional stats columns for sig. strikes, takedowns, etc.
- Additional stat cards (striking, grappling) located in `<section class="b-list__info-box">` elements beneath the hero section.

## Events & Fights (Optional)

- Events page: `/statistics/events`.
- Individual event pages list fights within `<tbody class="b-fight-details__table-body">`.
- Fights detail pages follow `/fight-details/<uuid>`.

## Observations & Edge Cases

- Some fighters lack reach or stance values (`--` string).
- Retired fighters may include "(Inactive)" in the hero section.
- Fight history includes exhibition bouts; result strings may include `NC`.
- Pagination includes letters filter (A–Z); `?char=a&page=all` returns full list beginning with `A`. We should crawl both `?page=all` to simplify.
- Fighter detail sections occasionally include `<p class="b-fight-details__chart-text">` placeholders; skip when empty.

## Next Steps

- Encode selectors into BeautifulSoup helpers for the initial prototype.
- Validate against a sample of fighters (champions + unranked) to ensure parsing robustness.
- Record HTTP status patterns (200 for valid fighters, 403/404 for retired or placeholder entries).
