Create a comprehensive plan for the following feature:

**Feature**: $ARGUMENTS

Please follow these steps:

1. **Generate a plan document** that includes:
   - Overview of the feature
   - Requirements and goals
   - Technical approach and architecture
   - Implementation steps (broken down into manageable tasks)
   - Files that need to be created or modified
   - Dependencies and prerequisites
   - Testing strategy
   - Potential challenges and edge cases
   - Success criteria

2. **Save the plan** as a markdown file in the `docs/plans/` directory with an appropriate filename based on the feature description. Use this naming convention:
   - Convert feature description to a descriptive filename
   - Format: `Feature_Name_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (include today's date)
   - Example: `Add_Fighter_Comparison_Tool_2025-11-04.md`

3. **Structure the document** with:
   - Clear heading hierarchy
   - Bullet points for lists
   - Code blocks for technical details
   - Any relevant diagrams or examples

4. **Reference existing code** where appropriate:
   - Review `docs/ai-assistants/CLAUDE.md` for project conventions
   - Consider existing architecture from the codebase
   - Ensure the plan aligns with current patterns

After creating the plan, provide a brief summary of what was planned and the filename where it was saved.
