# Data Directory

- `raw/` – HTML snapshots captured during scraping.
- `processed/` – Normalized fighter JSON used by the backend.
- `cache/` – Temporary artifacts (pagination caches, etc.).
- `samples/` – Small sample dataset generated by `make scrape-sample`.

These subdirectories are excluded from version control. Create them locally as needed.
